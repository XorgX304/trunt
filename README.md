# Trunt
=======

A lazily implemented C preprocessor for the lazy.

Should be able to be extended easily.



## Compiling
======

`make`


## Running

`trunt file.h`

This will spit the processed file into stdout. Run something like below to store the result in a file

`trunt file.h > file_processed.h`

Need some make trickery in order to use this in a project, see [private] on how to do so.
